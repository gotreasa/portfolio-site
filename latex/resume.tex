%     \section{Another section}
    
%     This page uses the page style \texttt{highlightmain} which shows the highlight bar (gray) and the main part (white background) but omits the header. 
%     The default page style is \texttt{headerhighlightmain} with all three elements.
%     If you don't want header, nor highlight bar, use page style \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}}.
%     \medskip
%     Neither main, nor highlight bar must be filled to make this template work.
%     It is possible to use a page style with the highlight bar but leave it empty by setting an empty highlightbar \texttt{\textbackslash highlightbar\{\}}.

% \pubforcefullwidth

% Demonstrate what an \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}} page looks like.
% Also show off the macros for publications that uses small icons for authors, date, journal and links.

% Achieving a good looking spacing can be tricky. For empty pagestyles where the full width is available use \texttt{\textbackslash pubforcefullwidth} to force the publoication list to take up all the available space.
% The (relative) lengths reserved for date, journal and links can be set with the parameters \texttt{\textbackslash pubdatelength}, \texttt{\textbackslash pubjournallength} and \texttt{\textbackslash publinklength} as in \texttt{\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash pubdatelength\}\{0.15 \textbackslash linewidth\}}.
